# Vanilla JS Todo List App

This build was originally constructed during a live one hour tutorial while tutoring for Unlock Academy to demonstrate and explain using DOM selectors and the fetch API. I've since cleaned up the code a bit. This isn't intended to be a full-fledge app, just a demo, but there are some TODOs to at least round out the basic CRUD functionality. Bootstrap was used for simplicity considering this was a live tutorial starting from zero. Also, this is purely a client side implementation; I used placeholder data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com for the API integration.

## Description
This basic implementation fetches a "todo" list using the built-in JS `fetch` function from a third-party API and allows the user to interact with the checkboxes.

## TODO
- [ ] allow an item to be added
- [ ] allow an item to be edited
- [ ] allow an item to be deleted

## Features / Skills Used
- API Integration: Uses the `fetch` API to GET and PUT data
- Bootstrap CSS
- Event Listeners
- HTML/JS Templating
